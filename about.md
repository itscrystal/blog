Welcome to my blog! Yoga+UX spawned from a realization of the parallels between UX, Design Thinking, and the classical teachings of Yoga. This is where I explore and challenge approaches and mindsets, from design and collaboration to empathy and the way we live our lives.

## My Story
By the way, my name is Crystal Tong. I'm a [UX Designer](http://crystaltong.co/), Researcher, [Yoga Teacher](https://www.instagram.com/yoginicrystal), and self-proclaimed Empathy Geek from California. Before this current life, I got my degrees in Psychology, Dance, and Theatre, and spent years as a collaborative choreographer and performing artist.

When I discovered UX, I was completely new to the tech industry and, quite frankly, a little overwhelmed. But it fired up my love for psychology, problem solving, empathy, creativity, and impact on the world. I dove into the challenge and completed 1000+ hours in an end-to-end UX Design apprenticeship at [Bloc](https://bloc.io). 

Now, I'm seeking more challenging UX opportunities to grow and improve. In the mean time, I'm designing a new iOS game with a small team, blogging, and chasing entrepreneurial pursuits. I also teaching yoga and meditation. Namaste~
