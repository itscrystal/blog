Hi there! My name is Crystal. I'm a UX Designer, Researcher, Yoga Teacher, and self-proclaimed Empathy Geek from California. 

Yoga+UX spawned from a realization of the parallels between the UX Design Process/Design Thinking and the classical teachings of Yoga. This is where I explore and challenge mindsets, designs, systems, perspectives, and so on.
